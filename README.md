This project focuses on predicting household energy consumption based on factors such as number of occupants, appliances, and square footage. By applying Linear Regression and testing different approaches, the goal is to understand which features are most relevant and how well machine learning can capture real-world energy usage patterns.

📂 Project Structure

test_energy_data.csv – Sample dataset containing household energy-related features.

test_energy_data_linear_regression.ipynb – Jupyter Notebook with step-by-step data analysis, preprocessing, visualization, and model training.

model.pkl – Saved machine learning model for easy reuse.

🔍 What’s inside

Data cleaning and preprocessing for reliable model input.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with correlation heatmaps and outlier detection.

Training and evaluation of Linear Regression models.

Accuracy measurement using metrics like MSE and R².

Exporting and loading trained models.

🚀 How to use

Open the notebook and run through the EDA + model building process.

Experiment with different features or models.

Load the trained model (model.pkl) for predictions on new data.
